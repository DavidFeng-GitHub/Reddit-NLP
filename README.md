# Reddit-NLP
This Research Report was conducted as part of the PB312: Research Apprenticeship module during my BSc. 

I applied NLP techniques including topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation) and supplmentary co-occurrence network analysis to examine the latent structure of dialogue norms across 11,000 subreddits extracted using Reddit API. Models were refined using a range of hyperparameter optimisation techniques. 

This socio-technical investigation aimed to extend our understanding of the typology of community rules on online platforms essential to designing moderation practices and technologies.
